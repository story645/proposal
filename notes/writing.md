What type of paper? 
*  model: Formalism, for papers that present new models,definitions, or terminology to describe techniques or phenomena. A key attribute of these kinds of papers is reflective observation. The authors look at what is going on in a field and provide a new way of thinking about it that is clear,insightful, and summative
*  systems: the research contribution of a systems paper is the discussion of architectural design choices and abstractions in a framework or library, not just a single application. 

What does it need?
* However, before you write up the paper about that hammer, I urge you to construct an understanding what kind of nails it can handle. Characterize, at least with some high-level arguments, the kinds of problems where your new technique shines as opposed to those where it performs poorly
* having a sentence near the end of the introduction that starts, “The contribution of this work is”, and of using bulleted lists if there are multiple contributions. 
    They are often quite different than the original goals of the project, and often can only be determined n retrospect. What can we do that wasn’t possible before? How can we do something better than before? What do we know that was unknown or unclear before?
*  Am So Unique: explain how it is different than what has already been done. All research takes place in some kind of intellectual context, and your job asauthor is to situate what you have done within a framework of that context. Agood previous work section is a mini-taxonomy of its own, where you decide on meaningful categorization given your specific topic.
     * explain why this previous work does not itself solve your problem, and what specific limitations of that previous work your approach does address. Every paper you cite in the previous work section is a fundamentalchallenge to the very existence of your project
* three choices: cite your source; delete the assertion fromyour paper; or explicitly tag the statement as your observation, your conjecture,or an explanation of your results
* The details are the how of what you did and belong at the heart of your paper. But you must first say what you did and why you did it before the how. - what, why, how!
* Instead, design your paper so that as much of the paper story as possible is understandable to somebody who flips through looking onlyat the figures and captions. 
* Does the paper describe something that has actually been implemented. It is always tempting to write a design paper describing a new system, then follow it up in a year or two with an "experience" paper. The successful papers of this genre nearly always include initial experience in the closing sections of the design paper. The subsequent experience paper then deals with the lessons learned from longer-term use of the system, frequently in unanticipated ways. Reviewers are very skeptical of design-only papers unless there are new ideas of obviously high quality.
