Data structure - Codd's algebra 
general structure $\G = {\R_1 ... \R_n}$ such that the tuples of any relation have components which are (atom, literal, node, leaf) or general structure
name of relation is pointer to relation, 

# Data types: (Munzner)
* tables
* images
* fields
* trees
* analytics functions
* joint distributions
* spatial databases might break Codd's semantics
    * point in line, point in polygon...
    * intersection, union
    * does aggregation exist on the data model here semantically sound?
    * https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html#predicates-and-relationships
    * zoom we need to State->City->Census -> blocks-> (optimization on polygon queries)
        * can it be represented as an & on a bunch of functions? 
table w/ 4 columns:
    * line segments + points - [((x,y), (x,y)), (x,y)]
    * project line to inequality 
* graphs w/ nodes - edges, and hypergraphs - graphs inside of graphs (software dependency trees)

## operations we need to preserve for visualiztion
* selection/filtering
* aggregation

## preserving structure?
* map(graph, database) - > have to hold that graph->database mapping in head when talking about operation - 
* structure is preserved semantically but not in the way we talk about it & can add a layer of confusio
* operations on these structures aren't native to codds, 
* might want to keep the structure rather then having to do the mapping hop


# Artists
Aesthetics is structure - functions mapping from one type of visualization to another
scatter as prototype or basis
artists are transformations on that visualization
A1 = scatter
ft(A1) = connect points for line = A2
ftt(A2) = line is made thicker
