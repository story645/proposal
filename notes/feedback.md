The consensus of the committee was that the status of the proposal should be
"conditional acceptance on minor revisions". These revisions are not "minor" in the sense of "not critical" ... they are. They are minor in that they require a reframing of the proposal (particularly in the introduction, abstract and conclusion) rather than a major rewrite througout. I have agreed that when she makes those revisions I will send them to the committee and wait a couple of days, evaluate them myself, and if there are no objections she would pass and I would send around for signatures. 

The the most serious of the concerns that must be fixed that the following points were not clear at all to several members of the committee

(1) Audience: It is not clear who the primary audience for this work. 
For example, perhaps this will support builders and designers of visualization libraries. There were aspects that seemed to indicate that the work was going to create a new conceptual model for people to use and understand visualization like Grammer of Graphics, and yet the framework didn't seem to explain that. Similarly if this was about building a low level library, the benefits in terms of performance were not spelled out and benchmarked. It was also not clear if this was meant to support info-viz, data-viz, scientific viz or all of them. The discussion of data seemed to indicate that somehow this would allow for automatic inference of structure of the data, which it clearly does not.

(2) Need: It woud be very helpful if there was an example that illustrated a figure using a current library which fails due to some criteria which whould not happen if the new framework were implemented. What problem that exists is being solved. That API's are more tangled than the could be is not a clear enough reason for a thesis. 

(3) Proposed solution: There was no clear statement of what the proposal's solution was. (eg. building a formal functional model for the transformation A, the aritist, in terms of what constraints it has), or at the very least that was buried. When asked what the work was about, there was difficulty in expressing that. This is a question which needs to be anticipated. If this is systems work, where is the library? If this is an algorithm what does it solve? If it were purely about architecture, you would have to show current architectures and state how the new one differs.

(4) Novelty: While the references we excellent and comprehensive, it was not made clear what is "new" here. It should be clearly stated as to what aspects of this contribution are novel.

(5) Benefits: It was not clearly stated what the benefits of this are. Readers/observers will want to know what concrete benefits this model has. Those were not stated.

(6) Evaluation: The method of evaluation to verify that the proposed solution delivers the stated benefits must be given.

(7) More specific discussion of what will be done and on what timeline.

Most of these concerns can be addressed in the introduction, background, abstract, and conclusion.
