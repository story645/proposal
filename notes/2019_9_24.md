# thesis notes 9/24

# To Do
    * write up discussion
    * next steps:
    
# First Pass
Do two overlayed images:
    * cat
    * quant
# Notes
* Array of multitypes
A, B are types 
A eg. numerical
B eg. categorical

C := A|B
    -> composing happens at colormap/normalization level 
    -> lets type system protect you 

Currently assumption is that data is inside the same units 
    * tradeoffs between letting the user do stupid things & constraint statisfaction
    * sanity checks on input (warnings)
    * bulk of domain specificity in 3rd party packages

Do the functional/theoretical bit in Haskell (reimplement to python):
    implement to these: https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/backend_bases_api.html?highlight=backend#matplotlib.backend_bases.RendererBase
    (talk to Anthony about how to write a backend)

concerns
* find if matplotlib talks to backends outside of backend base/ special case 
* capture a plot to see if it can be recreated (undo/redo stack)
* signals will do different things depending on the backend (replayed code doesn't jive back)
* recording sequence of calls -> log + pickle arguments on the backend the sequence of steps

Objectives:
* types get passed in with units/structures, produce plot in clean/functional way 
* backends: what is output independent of a particular backend 

# path:
 data gets passed in -> scatter plot -> backend: `ax.scatter() + ax.legend() + ax.colorbar()`

# Concrete next steps:
    * write down current/proposed interface/api, 2 for each plot type:

    ```python
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.scatter([2, 3, 4,1], [1,2,3,4], c=['cat', 'dog', 'cat', 'dog'])
    ax.legend()
    ```

    prototypical:
    * bar chart
    * scatter chart
    * heatmap
    * line chart

Next meeting: share notebook/github 
also share plots as they're done, ( online)
send out doodle poll for next two weeks
