Sheaf:
Category to a Set, 
 
Presheaf: Category Op ->

K is a topological space, 

category - objects of category are all the open sets in K
    - o1 = U1, o2=U2, 
    - preorder b/c $U_{i} \subset U_{j}$ which means $U_{i}<= U_{j}$
      - satisfies transivity, reflexivity 
  - - C is a functor if C is an open set, inclusion as partial order, everybody is included in K
  - K is the max, minimum is the emptyset $\varnothing$

sections over U = $U \rightarrow \Gamma(U_i, E_U)$, $U \subset K$, 


restrict E to U
* K \rightarrow E Set
* $\rightarrow$ input is the type itself 
* 
  * (object of the category, one of the open set, instance would be point on openset)

given an open set, give back sections into E over open set (is also a set)
    - section in set of sections is map from point in open set to value in fiber 

given 
$U_1 \hookrightarrow U_2 -> U_1 \subseteq U_2$
$\Gamma(U_1, E_1) \leftarrow \Gamma(U_2, E_2)$ <- pullback

$\Gamma(U_1, E_1)$ etc are objects in the category of Set (set of sections)
(function over earth over equator)
 K is an object of the category of open sets contained in K 

 Cop b/c arrows need to go in otherway, functor is cause arrows go in otherway, 
 contravariant functor or define the arrows going the other way Cop, F is a functor from Cop to Sets

 $U \rightarrow F \Gamma(U, E_u)$ -> arrow returns set of sections over that open set
where does this object go to the set of objects in the category of set 

function: sets to sets
domain: set of objects, range: set of objects, not a mathematical function

Artist:
category E, 
arrows in the same direction is a covariant functor


objects which are contravariant in one and covariant in the other are profunctors, 
not functions from C to D, check wiki for exact notation, 
cartesian product doesn't hold for non-trivial bundles, 

data objects/bundles form category, with objects K with all possible base spaces & bundle
graphic objects 

artist is a natural transform between these functors, if we want artist to preserve this
- structure, should be a natural transform between 
- nu is a natural transform, maps g of C/E into something in D/V 
  - g is morphisms (actions)
  - post composition is a natural transformation

high level
- artist is a natural transformation between profunctor objects which are category of sheaves on side to category of sheaves on the other side
Butler is sheafs, Kindlemann is fibers, both are sheaf maps, sheaf is a functor, same functor over S/H, natural transformation
    - equivariance and preservation of continuity is a special case of natural transformations
- to get NT that preserves this, artists is composition of nu, Q, and xi, E, H, 
- , it induces a natural transformation,therefore equivariant and preserves continuity, structure of the value schema, 
- define artist in terms of its pieces/what this constraint would mean, formulate what it means to preserve this, special cases are equivariance and continuity
- if you have an artist it should be (nu, Q, xi), E, H <- is the thing you implement
- claim: set these things up, artist w/ these parts and properties line up

nt from some category of sheaves to other category of sheaves
- category of functors to other category of functors
- here's a particular construction
  - E, H, V->I,  nu, q, xi,
  - show that the artist is a natural transformation
F = decomposition of F into independet and dependent variables
$F_I$ = index variables, Butler - K doesn't have coordinates on them, K is underlying space, coordinates are functions on K-> Munzner coordinates as indexers, Butler coordinates are other functions on F which is surface
- canonical profunctor is pre and post composition, arrows
  - formulation is specifically for trivial bundles
