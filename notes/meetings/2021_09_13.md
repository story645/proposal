1. replace E w/ D, V with R? 
   - notation shuffle:
     - E->D, V->R, P->V, D->P, H->O
   - A scale is a function and its inverse [31],
between a data domain D and retinal range R:
Scale: {data values in D}f−−⇀↽−−f −1
{retinal values in R
- for example , R is akin to the retinal variables 
  - P is akin to the retinal variables
  - total space E = K \times F (is a trivial bundles)
    - D is always on a fiber level
  - change base space to B? 
  - fibers on the visual side are R retinal variables 
    - P for paramters of something on screen, could correspond to retinal variables 
      - M or N ? Artist/ Intermediate/Parameter bundles 

2. how much intro topology? (I think I need open sets since it's important for grokking sheafs)
- fiber is cartesian cross product of , inverse image under the projection map
- section, bundle, etc, 
- open sets, sheafs, can restrict to subsets 

3. Q: assembling parameters into graphic, Q is aware of topology, outputs r,g,b,x,y,z from what it's given, , SVG level where Q has top part, gets out serialization where everything is specified out to screen, absorb nu into Qs
    Qhat input data parameterization, output Q output rho which only takes in renderer/screen <- serialization of the rhos>, decorate the nus however you want into Q

4. A goes from category E to category H, is a functor, formulation encapsulates what we mean by constraints, A is a profunctor 'cause of \xsi, or Cop-map going backwards is from category of base spaces to category of base spaces (has nothing to do w/ fiber), A has two args, map going backwards (profunctors is getters, setters, etc) - map going one way and backwards, two arguments -> one in object of one category, reverses in other category,

category is E, K, H, S, <- object is the space of all sections over K), 

\Gamma(E) x S |->\Gamma(H) x K -> What happens E->H, define what this map is and categories on either side, topological spaces + arrows as continuous maps between spaces (continuity side of things is pullbacks of continuous maps)

sections can pull back, new continous bundle 
- a contribution of the work we can describe equivariance with respect to continuity, formulate it to create a category such that arrows are structure we want to preserve
  - continuity -> base space to base space (carries over sheafs)
  - data to visual parameters -> fiber space to fiber space, scale invariance/ordering/etc| functor (pulls over actions )


4. little change: make the script more scripty
