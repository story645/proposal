# Reviewer Notes
1. localized neighborhoods are not a thing
2. tree or graph 
   1. could be a base space w/ a section w/ every node or edge a function into the fiber
   2. graph is fixed, structure
      1. minumum Fiber is 1D (station name, line #)
         1. what is the data? 
      2. fiber on edge is 1D - distance
   3. graph as data is F 
   - topology is only independent, everything else is f(k)
   - connectivity, latitude and longitude 
     - city but no subway anywhere 
   - K is a structural thing that does not change
     - tau is values over k
   - K could be a graph or the graph could be in the fiber
    - data on graph is tau, graph is K
    - graph can also be in fiber, and there might be a different K
3. downplay monoids 
   1. equivariance: monoid action on fiber bundle 
      1. group action, artist should be a functor
      2. preserves axioms, special case is the group actions, monoid actions, etc
   2. worth a mention of formally correct but not all formally correct things make sense semantically 
      1. graphical design -> not trying to be inferential
4. what does this let you do that you can't?
   1. wrong question: how does it benefit library developers
   2. this a way to express why these two things are different [table, [image,line]]
   3. framing the case study, work in terms of what it lets you do:
      1. add understandbility & humans can reason about it 
   4. benefits it gives library developers is how to atructure code/architect a library, thing you can do that you can't: phrase constraints
      1. can not pose a request to mpl or VTK that continuity or equivariance can be preserved 
   5. artist has constraints they will enforce, -> currently user matches data to artist
      1. this pushes it to the artist layers
5. make clear that you're saying locally trivial to make math easier
   1. how: b/c it means that a section in a small enough piece is a function, rather 
   2. locally trivial gaurantees that we can look up data associated with a location in the topology (function f(k)), non-trivial does not have that gaurantee
6. is artist a functor
   1. fiber bundle and particular sheaf of K and E, category that has one object
      1. any map that preserves structure of sheaf to itself
         1. equivariance on fiber
         2. A is a map from sheaf to another sheaf, it commutes
         3. two different sheafs, artist can map both of them & can preserve any sheaf that the artist can map
         4. subcategory of all sheaves of all bundles
   2. what is the category and what is the arrows?
      1. topological space 
         1. category: open_sets
         2. morphisms: inclusions, continuity
   3. nu/xi/q induces a functor
      1. category of real #s, morphisms are maps to themsles 
      2. ctegory of r2, morphisms of rs to itself
      3. function f induces a functor betw

functor:
1. arrows between objects in category
2. unravel back to definition
3. what is the category 

continuity: local to global
equivariance: fiber space 
k is a topological space
- sheaf is a category
 - category of open sets on K, arrows are inclusions
- sheaf is a map of space of sections into set of sections that satisfies a restriction + gluing property
- sheaf is a functor: (top to set)
- natural transformations  
- objects: sheaf, morphisms: group, monoids, etc
- map from on sheaf to another sheaf -> sheaf map: constraint 
- want a sheaf map which is also a functor 
  - map of sheaf to itself, that's preserved (sheaf map that's also a functor)
  - \script{A} is a map of sheaf to another sheaf, which is a functor

- constraints: Valid script E, H
- \script{E} - sheaf of (E)
  - E -> fiber, base space, map tau connecting them which gives back data
  - sheaf is how E over subset U \sub K is glued together
  - H is a graphic sheaf 
  - A is a map between sheafs
    - continuity is preserved b/c the sheaf is gluing rules
    - gluing rules go from data side to graphic side
    - how do I make this not handwavy
      - A should be a sheaf map
      - A should be equivariant 
        - E to itself, carry over H to itself
          - diagram should commute
    - limits: does not mean that every possible sheaf map or notion of equivariance arises from K or Q
      - 
    - (16) is how A does it's magic


# Outline
## Code Question
bar: one transform(nu), transform(x)

1) implement scatter and line first
2) line w/ non commutative transforms 
   1) 
3) build box in data space: path nu or part of q
   1) for non-commutative transforms
   2) two classes: 
      1) transform before addition, - specify my barwidth in axes fraction 
      2) addition before transform -> fabricate a path 
   2) make mu might have to fabricate 
      1) multivariate nu 
      2) push path up to nu, helper function for composing w/ axes
   3) line, error bar 

### math
10) functor is map of objects to objects 
    - doesn't tell you how this stuff gets mapped
    - object as element of whole thing - is this a function or a functor 
    - we unpack it as section maps (16)
    - artist knows how to work on sheaf
      - subcategory - whatever valid maps? 
    - equivariance: whichever actions on one side on the other, including monoid, group, etc
    - inclusion: data bundle, map x to y, other guy is gonna preserve it 

11) category is collections of objects w/ identity and associative compositions. in our case, object are sheafs, functions from object to object of equivariant monoid actions
   1)  all the maps that I could have by composition
   2)  all the arrows are a full subcategory, sheafs you can use for scatter plots
   3)  maps from one to another
   4)  map that category from to another, visual sheafs

12) viewing data as sheafs w/ equivariant actions, temperatures as maps is different, choice of how you're thinking about the data is part of formatting, & graphic is sheaf that has equivariant structure
13) is functor cause has to preserve maps 
14) not saying that every sheaf map from e to h is equivariant
   5) e are sheafs w/ monoid action w/ maps back to itself
      1) is monoid cause don't know if you can invert those maps
      2) maps of those, some endomorphism of sheaf to other endomorphism of sheaf
      3) artist is just gonna preserve that
      4) show a particular way in which they can be preserved 
      5) sheaf w/ a monoid action to a monoid action
   6) Artist has the properties of being a structure preserving map 
      1) sheaf w/ monoid action to sheaf w/ monoid action
      2) artist have these properites cause of the way their built (16)
      3) not claiming all equivariant structure preserving sheaf maps are artists
      4) just saying if you construct artists in this way, they have these properties
      5) can build the artist around this
    1) equivariant part means we have this one sheaf, pieces of open sets
       1) multiplication on it by scaling one of the fibers, will map whole sheaf to itself
       2) know where to send any open section
       3) know where to sent the monoid action, (raising something up, shifting it to the next node up) -> well defined map on the whole sheaf
          1) asking for those things to preserve structure
          2) if you have these maps, creates maps at the sheaf level
          3) if you have a pullback map at the bundle level, also have a map of sections that goes the other way 
    1_ V: all positions and distances need to be in pixel space in V

# constants
2) base space K w/ a single point k - is one row
3) column names are keys, things in boxes are values - is a dictionary
   1) one space is one bundle over one point
   2) section of that bundle is a dictionary
   3) global information is still a bundle
3) cartesian product w/ other spaces -> all the things need to know about bounds, etc
   1) one fiber goes to one nu 

### priorities
1) figure out the categorical story 
   1) objects, what are the morphisms, 
      1) nu, q, xi ? what is their role

# case study
- framing that this is about enforcing constraints in API 
- not to show a visualization this model allows for, illustrate how the constraint specification happens in code, keeping it simple for clarity. We use a bar chart to reduce complexity...
  - just the signatures
  - then how it's all put together
  - refer to side reference that links out to repo w/ code example
  

# rework
1) intro categories & sheafs in intro
2) lets us introduce artist equation at top of math
3)
