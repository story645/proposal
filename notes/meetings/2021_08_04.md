### math:
- Are the categories Top? E - V - H
- Are nu, q, and xi functors?
- orbit
- homotopy extension?
- summary:
  - spaces have homotopy type and can be homotopy equivalent, families of functions are homotopys, two functions are homotopic if there's a homotopy between them

### composition
* $+$: $\nu$ maps fibers to same coordinates
  * there isn't a connection between the different things on screen
  * don't need to be hooked together
* $\hookrightarrow$ inclusion in K is preserved on screen 
  * all these things update together b\c they're elements of the same section
  * language for specifying what needs to go together
  * can also have inclusions at the fiber level 
  * K - what variables are considering continuous?
    * you get to mark up what continuity gets carried over
  * fiber inclusions for computations
    * parts of the fiber have identicalb types + nus as precomputation fiber
    * Ks are different
    * maybe is just update the nu
time -> histogram
* map from k1 -> k2
* k1: time, k2: temp
* map from section in E1 to section in E2
  * probably something that maps through both and is coherent - down & up again
* base space inclusion:
* fiber inclusion: subset of fiber space can be included in total fiber space 


### computational stuff
* punt to a different paper 
* "+ is rules on connecting things that already exist"
* building on previous work to explore this


$\mathscr{E}$ - sheaf of objects over the open sets of k
morphisms - pull backs of inclusions, arrows are graph of inclusion maps
- bundle encodes return type, gamma is piece over bundle
- visualization of all those glued together back to data
