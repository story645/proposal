Concerns:
* pure data land
    * computational transforms
    * row turned into histogram
    * data -> data
* what is the essence of an artist?
    * visual mappings between data and RVs 
    * RVs->pixels (CW simplex?)
    * RV is spec is on visual side
    * core artist algebra stuff
* api between datasource & artist/RV
* peel away data side and all visual transformations
    * what connects data -> visual, artist instructs/encodes,
    * temperature gets connected to type of colormap, location is position
    * connection between retinal variable & the data and what variable it's encoding
    * remove transforms of dataitself and color itself
    * left with placeholder to instantiate when visual itself 
* spec language (altair, viz)
    * how do you specificy this stuff, is rules of grammar of how you specificy these things
    * driven by what "can" be done by the data
* algebra version
    * specs is nodes in graph/ set of 
    * artists are edges/functions form one form to another
    * as long as constraints are met, will do mapping
    * decorator - transform of arguments and outputs, artists  
        * 1 D array -> scatter plot primitaive connects dot /w position -> position
        * scatter(1D) -> position
        * other aesthetics need to be encoded/are fixed config, (RcParams)
* homogenous 2D array w/o any other info
    - could be an image
    - could be obs by samples
    - could be samples by obs
    - given data, artist specifies constraint
- artists have minimal constraints/implied bindings
    - imshow - pixel bindings = color, image is same shape as inpu so position at i,j is also bound to pixel at i,j
    - collection of those bindings as some list of things
    - imshow can also be a mapping of continous field to plain

- 2D heterogenous array - heatmap/matshow, interpolation makes no sense here
    - imshow as scatter/

- identify core semantic data groups
    - if you are a continous field, I as an artist need....
    - if you are a discrete table, I as an artist need....
    - artist is going to specifiy that color is value of field or whatever, position bound to ....
    - knowing metadata is important
        - bounding box in data space
        - units of data
- function needs to define what it needs 
    - f(x,y) ->z, binding for an imshow
        - pos=(x,y), z=color
        - to figure out what to do with that need to specific a domain (which is the bounding box)
        - in RV space, by default or spec using this colormap, this resolution of display, etc...

- Implemeneting imshow
    - object of some kind, type of some kind
    - middle just creates bindings 
    - output is color or whatever
        - maybe returns decorator that does the thing? 
        - collection of partially bound functions (facilitates lazy evaluation of image)
        - executed functions return set of pixels at positions w/ colors

- Currying
    - input to scatter plot is a data function,
    - allows you to have iterable that includes map function for individual elements
    - in scatter plot, x1 independent of x2 ...definition of functor (ufunc)
    - want flexibility of datastructure, retain structer & semantics (keep groupings) 
        - minimal thing is to map individual elements to glyph/glyph parameters
            - map(f, list)->list
            - map(f, tree) -> tree
            - maybe put x bound on temperature
            - review great good haskell maps
            - mapping w/ map of per data instance what goes to what

- Each of the primitives has a ufunc that transforms the data into the form it needs
