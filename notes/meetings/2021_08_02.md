# math:
- Are the categories Top? E - V - H
- Are nu, q, and xi functors?

# software
- case study approach - minimal that is functional + topologically complex

# paper structure
i. intro start here w/ libraries section from related work
    i. frame that this is about architecture & not graphical design in 1st sentence & use that to guide discussion of libraries
        - gd bakes topology into its decisions, architecture is about guaranteeing those decisions are faithfully executed
ii. related work: 
    i. topology
    ii. equivariance
iii. model
    i. categories/topological spaces (refer back to related work/ S&K/Butler already introducing these)
        i. E
        ii. V
        iii. H
    ii. morphisms
        i. xi
        ii. nu
        iii. Q
    iii. compositions
        i. maybe appendix?
iv. case study-maybe mirror morphism unpacking?
    i. sketch out A
    ii. xi (data wrapping, view)
    iii. nu
    iv. Q
v. discussion - practical implications, limitations of math, what's left for who
vi. future work - organized by what for who, use diss as guide
vii. conclusion - restate work as solution in terms of problem stated in intro
