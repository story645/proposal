### math:
- Are the categories Top? E - V - H
- Are nu, q, and xi functors?

### software
- case study approach - minimal that is functional + topologically complex

### paper structure
xref: [more detail version](../../draft/outline.md)
1. intro start here w/ libraries section from related work
    1. frame that this is about architecture & not graphical design in 1st sentence & use that to guide discussion of libraries
        - gd bakes topology into its decisions, architecture is about guaranteeing those decisions are faithfully executed
2. related work: 
    1. topology
    2. equivariance
3. model
    1. categories/topological spaces (refer back to related work/ S&K/Butler already introducing these)
        1. E
           1. K
           2. F (w/ monoids discussion here)
           3. \tau
        2. V
        3. H
    2. morphisms
        1. xi
        2. nu
        3. Q
    3. compositions - maybe appendix?
4. case study-maybe mirror morphism unpacking?
    1. sketch out A
    2. xi (data wrapping, view)
    3. nu
    4. Q
5. discussion - practical implications, limitations of math, what's left for who
6. future work - organized by what for who, use diss as guide
7. conclusion - restate work as solution in terms of problem stated in intro
