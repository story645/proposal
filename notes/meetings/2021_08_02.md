### math:
- Are the categories Top? E - V - H
- Are nu, q, and xi functors?
### software
- case study approach - minimal that is functional + topologically complex

### paper structure
xref: [more detail version](../../draft/outline.md)
1. intro start 
    1. frame that this is about architecture & not graphical design in 1st sentence & use that to guide discussion of libraries
        - gd bakes topology into its decisions, architecture is about guaranteeing those decisions are faithfully executed
        - later we show that using this model we can describe architecture of existing libraries 
        - what is the correct way to think about internals of visualization libraries?
          - all of them work, all different & proposing more general version
          - how to think about the code
   - given math, we use functional which has these benefits
2. related work: 
    1. topology
    2. equivariance
3. model
    1. categories/topological spaces (refer back to related work/ S&K/Butler already introducing these)
        1. E
           1. K
           2. F (w/ monoids discussion here)
           3. \tau
        2. V
        3. H
    2. morphisms
       1. what is the artist big picture, what are the constraints 
           1. xi
           2. nu
           3. Q
    3. compositions - maybe appendix?
4. case study-maybe mirror morphism unpacking?
    1. sketch out A
    2. xi (data wrapping, view)
    3. nu
    4. Q
5. maybe move library discussion here
   1. here w/ libraries section from related work
   2. using this model, we see these libraries doing this thing 
6. discussion - practical implications, 
7. limitations of math, what's left for who
8. future work - organized by what for who, use diss as guide
9. conclusion - restate work as solution in terms of problem stated in intro

Notes
- given this model, what parts are expressed, aligned, ignored
  * matplotlib thinks in sections not E
  * nus and qs and the like are messy
    * lack of clean notion of Q so no serializability 
  * E and V separation 
  * is vtks nu language as expressive 
  
  ### what do we want to show off?
- topologically complex
- something w/ metadata (marked up)
- a table can be scatters, lines, images
  - w/ nu different aesthetics but same meanings
  - change types in fiber
  - keep it simple/clean
- w/ synthetic, you know what it's supposed to look like
- nested topologically complex structure (k)
  - discrete
  - 1D continuous
  - 2D continuous
  - networks - graphs
  - inclusions
  - metadata & dependent variables separate from K 
  - data lives on nodes, edges, faces - lines on nodes, edges, faces 
    - we haven't discussed this yet 
    - maybe we do a simplices discussion (short as part of the case study)
    - one model of representing the topology is using simplices
    - line vs step - continuous vs piecewise continuous
      - may in actuality have to do piecewise linear continuous
      - stair and line are the same in Q, broken up differently in E
      - enrich w/ computation (to get histogram)
- equivariance
  - nu, E->V equivariance is preserved 
  - multiple measurement types (possibly something partial order)
  - multidimensional measurement ((wind speed, direction), swirls)
    - 2D colormaps
  - multiple nus
    - copy fiber
  - chained nus on implementation side  

Q: how does this do both equivariance and topology?
  - preserve forwards maps from nu when smashes together
  - construct in H something that has backward map xi
  - topology preservation maybe in Q_hat<-Q  since S->K has to be surjective deformation retract

Limitation/discussion
1. rehash of monoid example but with semantically nonsensical version, frame it as a plus b/c semantics are for domain experts 
2. continuous/ordered, no distance requirement line is straight  
   1. color weather data red=cold, blue=warm
   2. shutters: 
      1. open:  green (science), red (not safe)
      2. closed: red (no science), green (safe) 

include datashader in discussion
    - more data than pixels
    - pipeline to do in smart way
    - what it smashed together to do its thing
      - solve via more abstraction
      - solve optimization via less
