# intro
- make clear this about enforcing graphical design specifications, not suggesting graphical designs 
- topology is one of the ways we enforce bookkeeping 
- audience who are interested in the theory/philosophy of libraries, language about what data depends on what data,  
- why topology? 
  - mislead people that there's a continuity that isn't there (line, image, )
  - need to know what bits of data are glued together, what needs to go together vs. not
    - Butler's interpolation, local to global, bookkeeping 
      - express constraints & specifications  - (management)
      - inputs/outputs/what data is needed to execute the computation, what data needs to be shared 
- fig: line and image going back to the same table, 
- break data up into triangles/cubes/etc as if they're independent, have to agree on the overlap, on the edge, shared memory has to be deployed - engineering requirements for making it possible to pipe the data through the pipeline,
  - describes how data can be cut up and carried through 
    - how much inherent structure the data has 
      - continuous in time space images/
- boundary between data containers & data structures,

emphasize: architecture of data visualization libraries
  - software engineering: how the topologies are glued together
  - graphical design: pull back to the data 

- what do viz libraries need to do?
  - not break data
  - not break graphical design specs
  - transform data to visual
  - expressing what should and shouldn't be preserved 
  - bookkeeping/describing the structure of data so it's carried across to the visualization
- image vs table have same container/different structure
  - trying to describe the semantics of this 
  - vtk has picked 9 special structures from Butler, no systematic theory for which one to pick
