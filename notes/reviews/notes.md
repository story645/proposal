1. language to have a pipeline to go through, describing a framework to be done

2. graphical design level versus architecture level 

3. concurrency or big data or -> needs examples of this, map reduce vectorization, nus column wise and rows column wise 

4. reworking the case study - new artists or line/scatter/ or image/heatmap <- data heat map, issue of the query that comes back, this is a pixel - via the xsi I know how to aggregate, comes across over of how to do aggregations in parallel
    i. giving up vectorization? is it supposed to be architecture
    ii. maybe in diagram single, in code as vectorized - high priority for visual artists, main selling point 
5. pan and zoom are part of xi
    i. maybe structure with the nu, q, xi as the top level headings

6. future work is interactions, data (multiple generations of derived data), whatever is in my disseration plan

7. sheaf tells you what is depenedent on what and what is independent since it is the rules that bind the sections, based on that, how do updates need to occur, need to identify what is dependent on what, what needs to get updated

8. shared state of data - all the parameters are fed by the same data state, breaks 
    - topology is what is shared, continuity having to do with vectorization, handle under the hood, not sold as a primary reason 

9. equivariance comes from the graphical design folks so that they can build their tools - build tools that supports them expressing their equivariance constraints, equiv as fundemental principal that we need

10. maybe push through to category theory

11. carefully frame examples as examples and then chase through, solve the problem brush 

12. figures as picture books 

### plan
TCVG R&R
i. double check for which TCVG it should be 
ii. tcvg + scipy + redo code 
iii. make a tighter plan for revisions
vi. need to be done in two months
    1. narrative/intro/story
    2. code + math
        - maybe rewrite as functors and strip out all those details/the proof
