## Deadlines
### Proposal 
V1 April ? (this date will be set by department)  
- [] revise and resubmit based on committee feedback 
- [] close out board https://github.com/story645/proposal/projects/3
- [] turn off line numbers?

### deliverables 
- [] chapter section: new artists 
    - [] code: at least 3 high level plotting functions (e.g. plot, scatter, imshow, bar)
    - [] code: implementation of artist with explicit reindexing (heatmap)
    - [] code: implementation of new prototype artists that do not inherit from Matplotlib artists
    - [] math: formalization of definition of equivalance class \vartisteq
    - [] write: what new artist looks like & how it differs from old artist (side by side or line by line)?
    - [] write: second general public version of this for developer docs 
    
- [] chapter section: data
    - [] code: at least 1 computational plotting function (e.g. hist, contour)
    - [] code: at least 2 types of data structures (e.g. array, list, dict, analytic function)
-   - [] code: implement a data object for a non-trivial fiber bundle
    - [] math: pin down how computations work -> transform to new bundle/selfbundle
    - [] write: add more data case studies 
    - [] write: triangulization/encoding data section
    - [] write: clarify non-trivial fiber bundle section 
    - [] reach: math/code/write-build distributed data source models and concurrent artists.

- [] chapter section: interactivity
    - [] code: demo of at least 1 complex interactive composite plot using new api (e.g. scatter with regression and parasitic histograms)
    - [] math: expansion of the mathematical framework for + and complex (^) addition
    - [] math: specification of interactive visualization
    - [] write: up ^ operator
    - [] write: figure: operator (two panel: math diagram, parasitic grid )

- [] chapter: building libraries
    - code: proof of concept 3rd party user-facing library with a biology partner that supports 
    - [] code: at least one type of structured data (for example, phylogentic tree or cryo-electron microscopy image) and one composite visualization.
    - [] math: formulation of a graphic with axes labeling
    - [] write: describe how all this fits together to build library (systems paper)
    - [] write: dev/api docs on building library using this architecture 
    - [] reach: du bois toy library

- [] chapter: lit review
    - [] rework w/ continuity framing (troy paper + chi taxonomy + more on tools maybe?)

- [] chapter: probabilistic forecast evaluation 
    - [] rework w/ complex structured data + computation bent?
