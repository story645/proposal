## Tasks
### Paper: https://github.com/story645/proposal/projects/5
V0: Monday 15 latest
- [ ] drop figures into template
- [ ] pare content down into template
- [ ] copy edit so is coherant

V0.1: Thur 18 (drop into MPL meeting, possibly send to committee for feedback)
- [ ] adjust abstract based on content
- [ ] clean up figures
- [ ] clean up words
- [ ] clean up references

V0.2: Sunday 21, 5:00PM PST
- [] abstract due

V0.3 Thursday 25:
- [] revisions based on feedback comments

V0.4 Wed 31, 5:00PM PST
- [] revisions based on exam feedback 
- [] submit paper

### Slides
V0.1 Fri 19
- [] add timeline/gant chart
- [] make clearer that this is math + implementation 
- [] incorporate figures changed for paper, w/ different font sizes/weights  

### Proposal 
V1 April ? (this date will be set by department)  
- [] revise and resubmit based on committee feedback 
- [] close out board https://github.com/story645/proposal/projects/3
- [] turn off line numbers?
### Dissertation 
math
- [] expansion of the mathematical framework for + and complex (^) addition
- [] formalization of definition of equivalance class \vartisteq
- [] specification of interactive visualization
- [] mathematical formulation of a graphic with axes labeling
 
implementation
- [] implementation of artist with explicit reindexing (heatmap)
- [] implementation of new prototype artists that do not inherit from Matplotlib artists
- [] implementation of ^ artist (brush linked parasitic axes)
- [] proof of concept 3rd party user-facing library with a biology partner that supports at least one type of structured data (for example, phylogentic tree or cryo-electron microscopy image) and one composite visualization.

reach
- [] exploiting the models section level formalism to build distributed data source models and concurrent artists.


## External presentations 

info viz short paper June 13
- [] fleshing out the non-trivial bundle section 
- [] implementing a data object for a non-trivial fiber bundle

Scipy July 12-July 18
- []

systems paper using this model:
- [] at least 3 high level plotting functions (e.g. plot, scatter, imshow, bar)
- [] at least 1 computational plotting function (e.g. hist, contour) that works with at least 2 types of data structures (e.g. array, list, dict, analytic function)
- [] demo of at least 1 complex interactive composite plot using new api (e.g. scatter with regression and parasitic histograms)
