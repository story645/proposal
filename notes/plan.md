V0.4 Wed 31, 5:00PM PST
- [] submit paper

### Slides
V0.1 Monday 23
- [] add timeline/gant chart
- [] make clearer that this is math + implementation 
- [] incorporate figures changed for paper, w/ different font sizes/weights  

### Proposal 
V1 April ? (this date will be set by department)  
- [] revise and resubmit based on committee feedback 
- [] close out board https://github.com/story645/proposal/projects/3
- [] turn off line numbers?
### Dissertation 
math
- [] formalization of definition of equivalance class \vartisteq
- [] expansion of the mathematical framework for + and complex (^) addition
- [] specification of interactive visualization
- [] mathematical formulation of a graphic with axes labeling
 
implementation
- [] implementation of artist with explicit reindexing (heatmap)
- [] implementation of new prototype artists that do not inherit from Matplotlib artists
- [] implementation of ^ artist (brush linked parasitic axes)
- [] proof of concept 3rd party user-facing library with a biology partner that supports at least one type of structured data (for example, phylogentic tree or cryo-electron microscopy image) and one composite visualization.


reach
- [] exploiting the models section level formalism to build distributed data source models and concurrent artists.
- [] du bois toy library
