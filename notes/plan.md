### in progress (trash version done):
 * thesis statement)
 * lit review 
    * is in bullet points
    * only ggplot/bokeh/d3/vtk
 * math/theory
    * math is in bullet points/glossery
    * simplex & render figures, 
 * implementation
    * line, scatter, bar, grouped bar
    * k=0 simplex, k=1 simplex, Iris data, Iris aggregated
 ### outstanding
 * background/lit review
 * math in paragraph write ups
    * fiber bundle + data figure
    * taus & how they combine into VI?
 * implementation write up tied back to math
 * conclusion/proposal for further work - can steal from proposal?

    - [] Nov 20: full draft of section (w/ actual figures)
- [] Nov 25: implementation write up (figures are made, probably needs process/software diagram)
    - [] Nov 23: scatter
    - [] Nov 24: line
    - [] Nov 25: bar + multibar
