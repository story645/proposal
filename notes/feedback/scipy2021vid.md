# matplotlib 2021 maintainer talk
* need a real camera/check for camera angles, but microphone was clear
* intro: losing track of my intro, who I am and what I do
* thanks: too many uhs
* why: i think I said vigirous rather than rigourous
* flow chart slides: can't see the slides in my video & in the talk I'm not really referencing the slides for that reason 
    * refer more closesly to the slides
    * add a scatter/plot/image update slide -> this can more naturally feed into a slide on topology [table, function, image slide] -> which can feed into topology slides
        - instead pass in same array and got line & image <- b/c these plots have different notions of topology 
        - scatter will explode 
* ðŸ¤¦ I introduced that the scatter is an artist after I talked about scatters and line
* introduced the problem w/ the objects first (data) rather than the transforms 
* took 5 minutes to get into topology :frown: slides
    - call it continuity preserving 
* use these and that -> USE PROPER NOUNS!
* say topological constraint before saying if something has satisified it
* equivariants slides needs to be broken out -> data, properties of data, graphic <-slide and me need to lead w/ the properties> 
* multivariate example
    * need a little box around the places that I want to zoom together 
    * I use topologically when I should just say linked index for this audience
    * use functional model but I hadn't really gone down that rabbit hole
* was actually on time! (I thought I'd run late)

time
- .47: make sure I have the screen sharing totally happening in advance
- 1.34: one too many kindas
- 1.50: reading out the rarch slide & forgot to really go into the whys like Tim suggested
- 2.34: what is mpls job slide -> should specifically talk about the elements on the slide, like slide doesn't seem to be doing so much work 
- 3.40: artist slide -> needs a drop down to the apis for the different artists I'm talking about -> doing too much tell, not enough show
- 4:30? can better fold this slide in by doing the drop down out of artist and talk about scatter, line, image instead of repeating
- 5:00: again talk about the onscreen elements again, say "hey, these arrows, we can use math to describe them"
- 6:40: "like I was saying" -> just reintroduce the concept 
- 7:00: jumps into scatter too plot, haven't really done the two sentence high level topology, see above about breakign this down as API->Continuity->flow chart
- 8:00: always frame this as map back, but need to explain what the job of that map back is 
- 8:?? completely lost the triangle plots, at least in the talking bits
- 8:45: not really about respecting, is about telling/expressing
- 9:30: I should do a blow up # line slide for property preservation as a lead in, same w. the scaling which got lost along the way
- 10:00: multivariate example -> I don't really mention time which is the underlying index that holds it all together
- 11:19: I'm trying to break down by station, so I should lead more concretely "Say I'm analyzing JFK and want to zoom"
- 12:03: again more tell than show about propogate 
- 12:32: can just make sea of arrows slide
- 12:33: kind of blazed through the takeaways slide

### where I wasn't clear
* livetweet: https://twitter.com/nicholdav/status/1416075373717164032
    * flow chart is idealized viz library, not current mpl
    * graphs vs. graphics -> maybe an informal notation slide
    * need to better delineate equivariance and topology -> property slide will probably help here
    * marked up data wrapper, not 1D structure
