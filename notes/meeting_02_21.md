Artist is responsible for one set of coordinates/normalization
    - arists own the data projection into renderer projection (CW-complex)
    - Line2D owns one coordinate projection 
    - AxesImage owns one norm/colormap
    - embrace composities 
    - need very clear language for negotiating between DataSources & Artists
