# where do we define required vs optional?
* maybe a bar factory function?
    * scatter, bar, k discrete
    * pipe which channels things over thats the same
    * constraint in factory function for the q and nu and - eq ax.bar, ax.plot
    * return an artist? 

* add defaults as close to the user as possible

* defaults + F, spec: nu + q
* wrap E with a default factory datasource thingy -> column name match the parameter name, push back the parameter name as a second column name for the data columns 


```python
def bar(schema, ... ):
    # make fiber bundle
    # make mu dataclass (fatten in mu directly)
    
    return partial(bar)(data) # thing returned by the bar factory
```
* sklearn type thing: set up the object with parameters, return A -> A(data) (transform is the callable) <- mpl artist is what lives in the draw tree that manages this

aesthetic_spec:
* nus: function, source=tau_column (column name), dest=mu_column (parameter)
* things in V have to be fully filled in visual coordinates
    * H is in renderer coordinates (x,y, r,g,b fiberbundle)
    * nu goes from E->V, factory function provides defaults
