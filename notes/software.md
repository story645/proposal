* programmer's activity is coding, but important but is execution of code
* shorten gap between static program (code) & dynamic process (execution)
* textual index to successive actions (code is text space, execution is time)
* procedures/functions needs sequence of textual indices same length as depth of the call stack
* textual/dynamic indices provide independent coordinates for tracking program progress
* go to jumps all over the coordinate system
* satisfy the requirement that a programmer independent coordinate system can be maintained
* takeaway: code & execution should be in sync
