# datasource maps D->Projection for artist (query)
# aesthetic maps P-> retinal variables (red, sqaure)
# artist maps retinal variables -> pixels (CW-complex)

# What artists end up:
#1. get plotting data (pull set of rows) - 
    # comes in as dict of bertin variables 
#2. dict of maps of floats to visual propeties
#    'size array' -> actual marker sizes
#    'data units' -> pixels
#3. push to vector model
