  abstract = {We introduce grounded evaluation as a process that attempts to ensure that the evaluation of an information visualization tool is situated within the context of its intended use. We discuss the process and scope of grounded evaluation in general, and then describe how qualitative inquiry may be a beneficial approach as part of this process. We advocate for increased attention to the field of qualitative inquiry early in the information visualization development life cycle, as it tries to achieve a richer understanding by using a more holistic approach considering the interplay between factors that influence visualizations, their development, and their use. We present three case studies in which we successfully used observational techniques to inform our understanding of the visual analytics process in groups, medical diagnostic reasoning, and visualization use among computational linguists.},

Such predictions have implicit uncertainty resulting from model structure, parameter uncertainty, and fundamental randomness in the physical system. In this work, we build probabilistic models for long-term forecasts that include the GCM ensemble values as inputs but incorporate statistical correction of GCM biases and different treatments of uncertainty. Specifically, we present, and evaluate against observations, several versions of a probabilistic forecast for gridded air temperature 1 month ahead based on ensemble members of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CFSv2). We compare the forecast performance against a baseline climatology based probabilistic forecast, using average information gain as a skill metric. We find that the error in the CFSv2 output is better represented by the climatological variance than by the distribution of ensemble members because the GCM ensemble sometimes suffers from unrealistically little dispersion. Lack of ensemble spread leads a probabilistic forecast whose variance is based on the ensemble dispersion alone to underperform relative to a baseline probabilistic forecast based only on climatology, even when the ensemble mean is corrected for bias. We also show that a combined regression based model that includes climatology, temperature from recent months, trend, and the GCM ensemble mean yields a probabilistic forecast that outperforms approaches using only past observations or GCM outputs. Improvements in predictive skill from the combined probabilistic forecast vary spatially, with larger gains seen in traditionally hard to predict regions such as the Arctic.},

Finally, we show a summary of techniques, highlighting their goals and distinguishing characteristics. We also briefly discuss some open problems and research directions in the fields of visual text mining and text analytics. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

@inproceedings{ambrosioSimilarityHomomorphismPragmatic2009,
  title = {From Similarity to Homomorphism: {{Toward}} a Pragmatic Account of Representation in Art and Science, 1880-1914},
  author = {Ambrosio, Chiara},
  year = {2009},
  abstract = {The years 1880-1914 were a time of intense experimentation in the visual arts. Representative conventions became variable, and artists deliberately departed from a concept of depiction considered as physical resemblance or photographic similarity. Visual representations progressed toward a conceptualization of figures and objects that transcended perceptual data, and the rendering of pictorial objects turned into an experiment involving complex visualization processes. This paper explores the interplay between artistic and scientific representative practices between 1880 and 1914. I argue that science and technology acted as substantial challenges upon the concept of resemblance in art and that the rhythm of scientific and technological discoveries at the turn of the 20th century paralleled a shift from a notion of similarity to one of homomorphism in the conceptualization of pictorial representation. Homomorphism denotes representations which dispense with a point-to-point correspondence between depicted objects and perceptual data. I developed the concept from a scholarly study of Charles S. Peirce?s pragmatic account of representation, and in particular his theory of iconicity. Peirce defined iconic signs as ?partaking in the character of the object? (CP 4.531), that is, as preserving the same relational structure as their object. A theory of iconicity as homomorphism successfully exemplifies representative relations based on structure preservation. Applied to 20th century representative practice, homomorphism offers a plausible explanation for representations in which a considerable conceptual effort is required, independently of a point-to-point correspondence between depicted objects and perceptual data. Using four case studies - the photographer Alfred Stieglitz and the painters Andr\'e Derain, Max Weber and Pablo Picasso - I argue that representative practice between 1880 and 1914 was strongly informed by experimental scientific practices and that the shift from figurative to conceptual representation in art was triggered by a more significant theoretical shift involving representation as a general philosophical notion. Rather than a normative quest for the necessary and sufficient conditions for representation, I will propose a pragmatic evaluation of the means and strategies through which artists and scientists devise perspicuous and useful representations of the world. My analysis of the correlations between artistic and scientific representations at the turn of the 20th century aims to fulfill a twofold purpose. From a historical viewpoint, it draws significant parallels between the experimental aspects of representative practices in art and science considered as ways of exploring natural phenomena and intervening upon them. From a philosophical viewpoint, my goal is to propose a novel epistemological framework to assess how the shift in the conceptualization of representations affected subsequent styles of knowing and experimental practices in art and science. Ultimately, by combining the relative merits of historical and philosophical accounts of representation, I will argue for the advantages and desirability of a philosophically informed history of representative practice.},

Using a screen input device such as a mouse, the analyst can specify, in a visual way, points or regions on the display and cause aspects of the display to change nearly instantaneously. Brushing is a collection of dynamic methods for viewing multidimensional data. It is very effective when used on a scatterplot matrix, a rectangular array of all pairwise scatterplots of the variables. Four brushing operations?highlight, shadow highlight, delete, and label?are carried out by moving a mouse-controlled rectangle, called the brush, over one of the scatterplots. The effect of an operation appears simultaneously on all scatterplots. Three paint modes?transient, lasting, and undo?and the ability to change the shape of the brush allow the analyst to specify collections of points on which the operations are carried out. Brushing can be used in various ways or on certain types of data; these usages are called brush techniques and include the following: single-point and cluster linking, conditioning on a single variable, conditioning on two variables, subsetting with categorical variables, and stationarity probing of a time series.},

We show how representational transparency improves expressiveness and better integrates with developer tools than prior approaches, while offering comparable notational efficiency and retaining powerful declarative components. Immediate evaluation of operators further simplifies debugging and allows iterative development. Additionally, we demonstrate how D3 transforms naturally enable animation and interaction with dramatic performance improvements over intermediate representations.},

We argue that an easy-to-use graphical system tailored for visualization is needed. In response, we contribute Protovis, an extensible toolkit for constructing visualizations by composing simple graphical primitives. In Protovis, designers specify visualizations as a hierarchy of marks with visual properties defined as functions of data. This representation achieves a level of expressiveness comparable to low-level graphics systems, while improving efficiency - the effort required to specify a visualization - and accessibility - the effort required to learn and modify the representation. We substantiate this claim through a diverse collection of examples and comparative analysis with popular visualization tools.},

  abstract = {While information visualization frameworks and heuristics have traditionally been reluctant to include acquired codes of meaning, designers are making use of them in a wide variety of ways. Acquired codes leverage a user's experience to understand the meaning of a visualization. They range from figurative visualizations which rely on the reader's recognition of shapes, to conventional arrangements of graphic elements which represent particular subjects. In this study, we used content analysis to codify acquired meaning in visualization. We applied the content analysis to a set of infographics and data visualizations which are exemplars of innovative and effective design. 88\% of the infographics and 71\% of data visualizations in the sample contain at least one use of figurative visualization. Conventions on the arrangement of graphics are also widespread in the sample. In particular, a comparison of representations of time and other quantitative data showed that conventions can be specific to a subject. These results suggest that there is a need for information visualization research to expand its scope beyond perceptual channels, to include social and culturally constructed meaning. Our paper demonstrates a viable method for identifying figurative techniques and graphic conventions and integrating them into heuristics for visualization design.},

  abstract = {Critical analyses provide information visualization practitioners with insight into the range and suitability of different techniques for visualization. Theory provides the necessary models and vocabulary to deconstruct, explain and classify visualizations, allowing the analysis and comparison of alternate designs, and evaluation of their success. While the critical vocabulary for information visualization in general is well developed, the same cannot be said for ?hybrid? information visualizations which combine abstract representation of data with figurative elements such as illustrations. Figurative elements are widely used in information visualization in practice and are increasingly recognized as beneficial for memorability. However, the information encoded by a figurative image and how that information contributes to the overall content of the visualization lacks robust definition within visualization theory. To support critical analysis of hybrid visualization, we provide a model of the information content of a figurative image, which we call the figurative frame model. We use the model to classify hybrid visualizations along two dimensions: information density in the images (defined as the number of features and preserved measurements) and integration of figurative and abstract forms of representation. The new vocabulary for analysing hybrid visualizations reveals how the figurative images expand the expressiveness of information visualization by integrating descriptive and abstract information and allows the formulation of new measures of visualization quality which can be applied to hybrid visualizations.},

One of the easiest and most useful methods is based on the boxplot. This method is particularly appealing since it does not use any outliers in computing spread. Two methods, one by Carling and another by Schwertman and de Silva, adjust the boxplot method for sample size and skewness. In this paper, the two procedures are compared both theoretically and by Monte Carlo simulations. Simulations using both a symmetric distribution and an asymmetric distribution were performed on data sets with none, one, and several outliers. Based on the simulations, the Carling approach is superior in avoiding masking outliers, that is, the Carling method is less likely to overlook an outlier while the Schwertman and de Silva procedure is much better at reducing swamping, that is, misclassifying an observation as an outlier. Carling's method is to the Schwertman and de Silva procedure as comparisonwise versus experimentwise error rate is for multiple comparisons. The two methods, rather than being competitors, appear to complement each other. Used in tandem they provide the data analyst a more complete prospective for identifying possible outliers.},

In this article we take a few steps in the direction of establishing such a foundation. Our approach is based on graphical perception?the visual decoding of information encoded on graphs?and it includes both theory and experimentation to test the theory. The theory deals with a small but important piece of the whole process of graphical perception. The first part is an identification of a set of elementary perceptual tasks that are carried out when people extract quantitative information from graphs. The second part is an ordering of the tasks on the basis of how accurately people perform them. Elements of the theory are tested by experimentation in which subjects record their judgments of the quantitative information on graphs. The experiments validate these elements but also suggest that the set of elementary tasks should be expanded. The theory provides a guideline for graph construction: Graphs should employ elementary tasks as high in the ordering as possible. This principle is applied to a variety of graphs, including bar charts, divided bar charts, pie charts, and statistical maps with shading. The conclusion is that radical surgery on these popular graphs is needed, and as replacements we offer alternative graphical forms?dot charts, dot charts with grouping, and framed-rectangle charts.},

Projection uncertainties have typically been addressed by analysis of a few scenarios, chosen based on availability or to capture the extreme cases among available projections. However, by focusing on more common projections rather than the most extreme projections (using a new resampling method), new insights into current projections emerge: (1) uncertainties associated with future greenhouse-gas emissions are comparable with the differences among climate models, so that neither source of uncertainties should be neglected or underrepresented; (2) twenty-first century temperature projections spread more, overall, than do precipitation scenarios; (3) projections of extremely wet futures for California are true outliers among current projections; and (4) current projections that are warmest tend, overall, to yield a moderately drier California, while the cooler projections yield a somewhat wetter future. The resampling approach applied in this paper also provides a natural opportunity to objectively incorporate measures of model skill and the likelihoods of various emission scenarios into future assessments.},

With this approach users are enabled to detect stable states, recurring states, outlier topologies, and gain knowledge about the transitions between states and the network evolution in general. The components of our approach are discretization, vectorization and normalization, dimensionality reduction, and visualization and interaction, which are discussed in detail. The effectiveness of the approach is shown by applying it to artificial and real-world dynamic networks.},

The InfoVis toolkit provides specific data structures to achieve a fast action/feedback loop required by dynamic queries. It comes with a large set of components such as range sliders and tailored control panels required to control and configure the visualizations. These components are integrated into a coherent framework that simplifies the management of rich data structures and the design and extension of visualizations. Supported data structures currently include tables, trees and graphs. Supported visualizations include scatter plots, time series, parallel coordinates, treemaps, icicle trees, node-link diagrams for trees and graphs and adjacency matrices for graphs. All visualizations can use fisheye lenses and dynamic labeling. The InfoVis toolkit supports hardware acceleration when available through Agile2D, an implementation of the Java graphics API based on OpenGL, achieving speedups of 10 to 200 times. The article also shows how new visualizations can be added and extended to become components, enriching visualizations as well as general applications},

  abstract = {In mathematics, and particularly topology, a fiber bundle (or, in British English, fibre bundle) is a space that is locally a product space, but globally may have a different topological structure. Specifically, the similarity between a space                         E                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle E\}    and a product space                         B         \texttimes{}         F                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle B\textbackslash times F\}    is defined using a continuous surjective map                        {$\pi$}         :         E         \textrightarrow{}         B                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash pi \textbackslash colon E\textbackslash to B\}   that in small regions of E behaves just like a projection from corresponding regions of                         B         \texttimes{}         F                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle B\textbackslash times F\}    to                         B                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle B\}   .  The map                         {$\pi$}                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash pi \}   , called the projection or submersion of the bundle, is regarded as part of the structure of the bundle.  The space                         E                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle E\}    is known as the total space of the fiber bundle,                         B                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle B\}    as the base space, and                         F                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle F\}    the fiber. In the trivial case,                         E                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle E\}    is just                         B         \texttimes{}         F                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle B\textbackslash times F\}   , and the map {$\pi$} is just the projection from the product space to the first factor.  This is called a trivial bundle. Examples of non-trivial fiber bundles include the M\"obius strip and Klein bottle, as well as nontrivial covering spaces.  Fiber bundles such as the tangent bundle of a manifold and more general vector bundles play an important role in differential geometry and differential topology, as do principal bundles. Mappings between total spaces of fiber bundles that "commute" with the projection maps are known as bundle maps, and the class of fiber bundles forms a category with respect to such mappings.  A bundle map from the base space itself (with the identity mapping as projection) to                         E                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle E\}    is called a section of                         E                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle E\}   .  Fiber bundles can be specialized in a number of ways, the most common of which is requiring that the transitions between the local trivial patches lie in a certain topological group, known as the structure group, acting on the fiber                         F                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle F\}   .},

For one of these, the graphical technique known as the boxplot, a selective survey of popular software packages revealed several definitions. These alternative constructions arise from different choices in computing quartiles and the fences that determine whether an observation is ``outside'' and thus plotted individually. We examine these alternatives and their consequences, discuss related background for boxplots (such as the probability that a sample contains one or more outside observations and the average proportion of outside observations in a sample), and offer recommendations that lead to a single standard form of the boxplot.},

  abstract = {Background Sexual segregation in vertebrate foraging niche is often associated with sexual size dimorphism (SSD), i.e., ecological sexual dimorphism. Although foraging behavior of male and female seabirds can vary markedly, differences in isotopic (carbon, {$\delta$}13C and nitrogen, {$\delta$}15N) foraging niche are generally more pronounced within sexually dimorphic species and during phases when competition for food is greater. We examined ecological sexual dimorphism among sympatric nesting Pygoscelis penguins asking whether environmental variability is associated with differences in male and female pre-breeding foraging niche. We predicted that all Pygoscelis species would forage sex-specifically, and that higher quality winter habitat, i.e., higher or lower sea ice coverage for a given species, would be associated with a more similar foraging niche among the sexes.  Results P2/P8 primers reliably amplified DNA of all species. On average, male Pygoscelis penguins are structurally larger than female conspecifics. However, chinstrap penguins were more sexually dimorphic in culmen and flipper features than Ad\'elie and gentoo penguins. Ad\'elies and gentoos were more sexually dimorphic in body mass than chinstraps. Only male and female chinstraps and gentoos occupied separate {$\delta$}15N foraging niches. Strong year effects in {$\delta$}15N signatures were documented for all three species, however, only for Ad\'elies, did yearly variation in {$\delta$}15N signatures tightly correlate with winter sea ice conditions. There was no evidence that variation in sex-specific foraging niche interacted with yearly winter habitat quality.  Conclusion Chinstraps were most sexually size dimorphic followed by gentoos and Ad\'elies. Pre-breeding sex-specific foraging niche was associated with overall SSD indices across species; male chinstrap and gentoo penguins were enriched in {$\delta$}15N relative to females. Our results highlight previously unknown trophic pathways that link Pygoscelis penguins with variation in Southern Ocean sea ice suggesting that each sex within a species should respond similarly in pre-breeding trophic foraging to changes in future winter habitat.},

By separatingspecification from execution, declarative languages can simplify development, enable unobtrusive optimization, and supportretargeting across platforms. We describe the design of the Protovis specification language and its implementation within anobject-oriented, statically-typed programming language (Java). We demonstrate how to support rich visualizations without requiring atoolkit-specific data model and extend Protovis to enable declarative specification of animated transitions. To support cross-platformdeployment, we introduce rendering and event-handling infrastructures decoupled from the runtime platform, letting designers retargetvisualization specifications (e.g., from desktop to mobile phone) with reduced effort. We also explore optimizations such as runtimecompilation of visualization specifications, parallelized execution, and hardware-accelerated rendering. We present benchmark studiesmeasuring the performance gains provided by these optimizations and compare performance to existing Java-based visualizationtools, demonstrating scalability improvements exceeding an order of magnitude.},

To address these issues, we have created prefuse, a software framework for creating dynamic visualizations of both structured and unstructured data. prefuse provides theoretically-motivated abstractions for the design of a wide range of visualization applications, enabling programmers to string together desired components quickly to create and customize working visualizations. To evaluate prefuse we have built both existing and novel visualizations testing the toolkit's flexibility and performance, and have run usability studies and usage surveys finding that programmers find the toolkit usable and effective.},

  abstract = {Visualizations often appear in multiples, either in a single display (e.g., small multiples, dashboard) or across time or space (e.g., slideshow, set of dashboards). However, existing visualization design guidelines typically focus on single rather than multiple views. Solely following these guidelines can lead to effective yet inconsistent views (e.g., the same field has different axes domains across charts), making interpretation slow and error-prone. Moreover, little is known how consistency balances with other design considerations, making it difficult to incorporate consistency mechanisms in visualization authoring software. We present a wizard-of-oz study in which we observed how Tableau users achieve and sacrifice consistency in an exploration-to-presentation visualization design scenario. We extend (from our prior work) a set of encoding-specific constraints defining consistency across multiple views. Using the constraints as a checklist in our study, we observed cases where participants spontaneously maintained consistent encodings and warned cases where consistency was overlooked. In response to the warnings, participants either revised views for consistency or stated why they thought consistency should be overwritten. We categorize participants' actions and responses as constraint validations and exceptions, depicting the relative importance of consistency and other design considerations under various circumstances (e.g., data cardinality, available encoding resources, chart layout). We discuss automatic consistency checking as a constraint-satisfaction problem and provide design implications for communicating inconsistencies to users.},

Often within the same package one definition will be used to compute a quantile explicitly, while other definitions may be used when producing a boxplot, a probability plot, or a QQ plot. We compare the most commonly implemented sample quantile definitions by writing them in a common notation and investigating their motivation and some of their properties. We argue that there is a need to adopt a standard definition for sample quantiles so that the same answers are produced by different packages and within each package. We conclude by recommending that the median-unbiased estimator be used because it has most of the desirable properties of a quantile estimator and can be defined independently of the underlying distribution.},

The third groups is composed of methods which perform simultaneously dimensionality reduction of the curves and clustering, leading to functional representation of data depending on clusters. The last group consists of distance-based methods using clustering algorithms based on specific distances for functional data.

  abstract = {In differential topology, the jet bundle is a certain construction that makes a new smooth fiber bundle out of a given smooth fiber bundle. It makes it possible to write differential equations on sections of a fiber bundle in an invariant form. Jets may also be seen as the coordinate free versions of Taylor expansions. Historically, jet bundles are attributed to Charles Ehresmann, and were an advance on the method (prolongation) of \'Elie Cartan, of dealing geometrically with higher derivatives, by imposing differential form conditions on newly introduced formal variables.  Jet bundles are sometimes called sprays, although sprays usually refer more specifically to the associated vector field induced on the corresponding bundle (e.g., the geodesic spray on Finsler manifolds.) Since the early 1980s, jet bundles have appeared as a concise way to describe phenomena associated with the derivatives of maps, particularly those associated with the calculus of variations. Consequently, the jet bundle is now recognized as the correct domain for a geometrical covariant field theory and much work is done in general relativistic formulations of fields using this approach.},

Because we believe the value of our model lies in its practical application, we propose three general principles for good visualization design. We work through a collection of examples where our model helps explain the known properties of existing visualizations methods, both good and not-so-good, as well as suggesting some novel methods. We describe how to use the model alongside experimental user studies, since it can help frame experiment outcomes in an actionable manner. Exploring the implications and applications of our model and its design principles should provide many directions for future visualization research.},

  abstract = {The notion of data depth has long been in use to obtain robust location and scale estimates in a multivariate setting. The depth of an observation is a measure of its centrality, with respect to a data set or a distribution. The data depths of a set of multivariate observations translates to a center-outward ordering of the data. Thus, data depth provides a generalization of the median to a multivariate setting (the deepest observation), and can also be used to screen for extreme observations or outliers (the observations with low data depth). Data depth has been used in the development of a wide range of robust and non-parametric methods for multivariate data, such as non-parametric tests of location and scale [Li and Liu (2004)], multivariate rank-tests [Liu and Singh (1993)], non-parametric classification and clustering [Jornsten (2004)], and robust regression [Rousseeuw and Hubert (1999)]. Many different notions of data depth have been developed for multivariate data. In contrast, data depth measures for functional data have only recently been proposed [Fraiman and Muniz (1999), L\&\#xf3;pez-Pintado and Romo (2006a)]. While the definitions of both of these data depth measures are motivated by the functional aspect of the data, the measures themselves are in fact invariant with respect to permutations of the domain (i.e. the compact interval on which the functions are defined). Thus, these measures are equally applicable to multivariate data where there is no explicit ordering of the data dimensions. In this paper we explore some extensions of functional data depths, so as to take the ordering of the data dimensions into account.},

  abstract = {This dissertation describes research on the graphical presentation of relational information. It presents theoretical results about graphical languages and a program that incorporates these results. According to the theory, a graphical language is a set of graphical sentences (such as bar charts, scatter plots, or connected graphs), each of which is a two dimensional arrangement of pixel objects. These languages are evaluated on the basis of two graphic design criteria: expressiveness is an indication of the kinds of relational information that can be expressed in a language, and effectiveness deals with the relative desirability of sentences from alternative graphical languages. A composition algebra is also developed that can be used to systematically generate a wide variety of graphical languages from a small set of primitives. These theoretical results are incorporated into a graphical presentation program called APT (A Presentation Tool). APT is unique in that its designs are sensitive to both the structure of the information and the output medium. The design process has three parts. First, the information is divided into components, each of which satisfies the expressiveness criterion for a primitive graphical language. Next, effectiveness criteria are used to select the most effective primitive graphical language for each component. Finally, composition operators are used to compose the individual designs into a unified presentation of all of the information. Even though only a few primitives are implemented, APT can synthesize a wide variety of designs that express information effectively.},

Two problems are raised by this goal: The codification of graphic design criteria in a form that can be used by the presentation tool, and the generation of a wide variety of designs so that the presentation tool can accommodate a wide variety of information. The approach described in this paper is based on the view that graphical presentations are sentences of graphical languages. The graphic design issues are codified as expressiveness and effectiveness criteria for graphical languages. Expressiveness criteria determine whether a graphical language can express the desired information. Effectiveness criteria determine whether a graphical language exploits the capabilities of the output medium and the human visual system. A wide variety of designs can be systematically generated by using a composition algebra that composes a small set of primitive graphical languages. Artificial intelligence techniques are used to implement a prototype presentation tool called APT (A Presentation Tool), which is based on the composition algebra and the graphic design criteria.},

  abstract = {In abstract algebra, a branch of mathematics, a monoid is a set equipped with an associative binary operation and an identity element. Monoids are semigroups with identity.  Such algebraic structures occur in several branches of mathematics.  For example, the functions from a set into itself form a monoid with respect to function composition. More generally, in category theory, the morphisms of an object to itself form a monoid, and, conversely, a monoid may be viewed as a category with a single object.  In computer science and computer programming, the set of strings built from a given set of characters is a free monoid. Transition monoids and syntactic monoids are used in describing finite-state machines. Trace monoids and history monoids provide a foundation for process calculi and concurrent computing. In theoretical computer science, the study of monoids is fundamental for automata theory (Krohn\textendash Rhodes theory), and formal language theory (star height problem).

  abstract = {Abstract             As widely accepted, justified by the historical developments of physics, the background for standard formulation of postulates of physical theories leading to equations of motion, or even the form of equations of motion themselves, come from empirical experience. Equations of motion are then a starting point for obtaining specific conservation laws, as, for example, the well-known conservation laws of momenta and mechanical energy in mechanics. On the other hand, there are numerous examples of physical laws or equations of motion which can be obtained from a certain variational principle as Euler-Lagrange equations and their solutions, meaning that the \textbackslash true trajectories" of the physical systems represent stationary points of the corresponding functionals.             It turns out that equations of motion in most of the fundamental theories of physics (as e.g. classical mechanics, mechanics of continuous media or fluids, electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, string theory, etc.), are Euler-Lagrange equations of an appropriately formulated variational principle. There are several well established geometrical theories providing a general description of variational problems of different kinds. One of the most universal and comprehensive is the calculus of variations on fibred manifolds and their jet prolongations. Among others, it includes a complete general solution of the so-called strong inverse variational problem allowing one not only to decide whether a concrete equation of motion can be obtained from a variational principle, but also to construct a corresponding variational functional. Moreover, conservation laws can be derived from symmetries of the Lagrangian defining this functional, or directly from symmetries of the equations.             In this paper we apply the variational theory on jet bundles to tackle some fundamental problems of physics, namely the questions on existence of a Lagrangian and the problem of conservation laws. The aim is to demonstrate that the methods are universal, and easily applicable to distinct physical disciplines: from classical mechanics, through special relativity, waves, classical electrodynamics, to quantum mechanics.},

Interfaces implementing these techniques were used by 40 subjects to perform a task that involved navigating a large hierarchical tree dataset and making topological comparisons between nodes in the tree. Our results show that Pan and Zoom Navigation was significantly faster and required less mental effort than Rubber Sheet Navigation, independent of the presence or absence of an overview. Also, overviews did not appear to improve performance, but were still perceived as beneficial by users. We discuss the implications of our task and guaranteed visibility on the results and the limitations of our study, and we propose preliminary design guidelines and recommendations for future work.},

  abstract = {We propose the bagplot, a bivariate generalization of the univariate boxplot. The key notion is the halfspace location depth of a point relative to a bivariate dataset, which extends the univariate concept of rank. The "depth median" is the deepest location, and it is surrounded by a "bag" containing the n/2 observations with largest depth. Magnifying the bag by a factor 3 yields the "fence" (which is not plotted). Observations between the bag and the fence are marked by a light gray loop, whereas observations outside the fence are flagged as outliers. The bagplot visualizes the location, spread, correlation, skewness, and tails of the data. It is equivariant for linear transformations, and not limited to elliptical distributions. Software for drawing the bagplot is made available for the S-Plus and MATLAB environments. The bagplot is illustrated on several datasets-for example, in a scatterplot matrix of multivariate data.},

  abstract = {Information visualization has often focused on providing deep insight for expert user populations and on techniques for amplifying cognition through complicated interactive visual models. This paper proposes a new subdomain for infovis research that complements the focus on analytic tasks and expert use. Instead of work-related and analytically driven infovis, we propose casual information visualization (or casual infovis) as a complement to more traditional infovis domains. Traditional infovis systems, techniques, and methods do not easily lend themselves to the broad range of user populations, from expert to novices, or from work tasks to more everyday situations. We propose definitions, perspectives, and research directions for further investigations of this emerging subfield. These perspectives build from ambient information visualization (Skog et al., 2003), social visualization, and also from artistic work that visualizes information (Viegas and Wattenberg, 2007). We seek to provide a perspective on infovis that integrates these research agendas under a coherent vocabulary and framework for design. We enumerate the following contributions. First, we demonstrate how blurry the boundary of infovis is by examining systems that exhibit many of the putative properties of infovis systems, but perhaps would not be considered so. Second, we explore the notion of insight and how, instead of a monolithic definition of insight, there may be multiple types, each with particular characteristics. Third, we discuss design challenges for systems intended for casual audiences. Finally we conclude with challenges for system evaluation in this emerging subfield.},

In other words, a subset of a quotient space is open if and only if its preimage under the canonical projection map is open in the original topological space. Intuitively speaking, the points of each equivalence class are identified or "glued together" for forming a new topological space. For example, identifying the points of a sphere that belong to the same diameter produces the projective plane as a quotient space.},

However, existing declarative visualization languages are primarily concerned with visual encoding, and rely on imperative event handlers for interactive behaviors. In response, we introduce a model of declarative interaction design for data visualizations. Adopting methods from reactive programming, we model low-level events as composable data streams from which we form higher-level semantic signals. Signals feed predicates and scale inversions, which allow us to generalize interactive selections at the level of item geometry (pixels) into interactive queries over the data domain. Production rules then use these queries to manipulate the visualization's appearance. To facilitate reuse and sharing, these constructs can be encapsulated as named interactors: standalone, purely declarative specifications of interaction techniques. We assess our model's feasibility and expressivity by instantiating it with extensions to the Vega visualization grammar. Through a diverse range of examples, we demonstrate coverage over an established taxonomy of visualization interaction techniques.},

  abstract = {The identification of contaminated observations or outliers is an important part of data analysis since such observations can have a profound influence and distort the analysis. One simple graphical method, based on the box-plot, consists of constructing fences. The fences method is not only appealing in its simplicity but more importantly because it does not use the extreme potential outliers which can inflate the computing of a measure of dispersion and hence lessen the sensitivity for identifying outliers. The commonly used fences procedure may be too liberal in some situations and too conservative in others. That is, it sets one criteria for all scenarios and does not afford the data analyst the flexibility of specifying the probability or criterion for designating an observation as an outlier in a variety of circumstances. Furthermore, the most commonly used procedure is a ``one size fits all'' style and does not incorporate sample size. Unfortunately, a value that is extreme in a small data set might be expected in a much larger sample. In this paper, a method is proposed to include sample size in constructing fences as well as a sequential procedure to identify multiple outliers at a specified probability.},

The inner and outer fences are defined in terms of the hinges (or fourths), and therefore are not distorted by a few extreme values. Such distortion could lead to failing to detect some outliers, a problem known as ``masking''. A method for determining the probability associated with any fence or observation is proposed based on the cumulative distribution function of the order statistics. This allows the statistician to easily assess, in a probability sense, the degree to which an observation is dissimilar to the majority of the observations. In addition, an adaptation for approximately normal but somewhat asymmetric distributions is suggested.},

  abstract = {In algebra and theoretical computer science, an action or act of a semigroup on a set is a rule which associates to each element of the semigroup a transformation of the set in such a way that the product of two elements of the semigroup (using the semigroup operation) is associated with the composite of the two corresponding transformations. The terminology conveys the idea that the elements of the semigroup are acting as transformations of the set. From an algebraic perspective, a semigroup action is a generalization of the notion of a group action in group theory. From the computer science point of view, semigroup actions are closely related to automata: the set models the state of the automaton and the action models transformations of that state in response to inputs. An important special case is a monoid action or act, in which the semigroup is a monoid and the identity element of the monoid acts as the identity transformation of a set. From a category theoretic point of view, a monoid is a category with one object, and an act is a functor from that category to the category of sets. This immediately provides a generalization to monoid acts on objects in categories other than the category of sets. Another important special case is a transformation semigroup. This is a semigroup of transformations of a set, and hence it has a tautological action on that set. This concept is linked to the more general notion of a semigroup by an analogue of Cayley's theorem. (A note on terminology: the terminology used in this area varies, sometimes significantly, from one author to another. See the article for details.)},

It includes 250 illustrations of the best (and a few of the worst) statistical graphics, with detailed analysis of how to display data for precise, effective, quick analysis. Also offered is information on the design of the high-resolution displays, small multiples, editing and improving graphics, and the data-ink ratio. Time-series, relational graphics, data maps, multivariate designs, as well as detection of graphical deception: design variation vs. data variation, and sources of deception are discussed. Information on aesthetics and data graphical displays is included. The 2nd edition provides high-resolution color reproductions of the many graphics of William Playfair (1750-1800), adds color to other images where appropriate, and includes all the changes and corrections during the 17 printings of the 1st edition"--Publisher's description},

It shows how familiar processes of visualization fit the semiotic frameworks of both Saussure and Peirce, and extends these structures using the tools of category theory to provide a general framework for understanding visualization in practice, including: Relationships between systems, data collected from those systems, renderings of those data in the form of representations, the reading of those representations to create visualizations, and the use of those visualizations to create knowledge and understanding of the system under inspection. The resulting framework is validated by demonstrating how familiar information visualization concepts (such as literalness, sensitivity, redundancy, ambiguity, generalizability, and chart junk) arise naturally from it and can be defined formally and precisely. This paper generalizes previous work on the formal characterization of visualization by, inter alia, Ziemkiewicz and Kosara and allows us to formally distinguish properties of the visualization process that previous work does not.},

This article builds on Wilkinson, Anand, and Grossman (2005), describing extensions and refinements developed while building an open source implementation of the grammar of graphics for R, ggplot2. The topics in this article include an introduction to the grammar by working through the process of creating a plot, and discussing the components that we need. The grammar is then presented formally and compared to Wilkinson?s grammar, highlighting the hierarchy of defaults, and the implications of embedding a graphical grammar into a programming language. The power of the grammar is illustrated with a selection of examples that explore different components and their interactions, in more detail. The article concludes by discussing some perceptual issues, and thinking about how we can build on the grammar to learn how to create graphical ?poems.? Supplemental materials are available online.},

It consists of a rectangular tiling, with each tile shaded on a color scale to represent the value of the corresponding element of the data matrix. The rows (columns) of the tiling are ordered such that similar rows (columns) are near each other. On the vertical and horizontal margins of the tiling are hierarchical cluster trees. This cluster heat map is a synthesis of several different graphic displays developed by statisticians over more than a century. We locate the earliest sources of this display in late 19th century publications, and trace a diverse 20th century statistical literature that provided a foundation for this most widely used of all bioinformatics displays.},

Typically, making this decision is not about whether one library is ``better'' than another, but whether the specific library is more suitable for what the developer is trying to achieve.To answer this question thoroughly, we need to better understand the design space of visualization libraries. The talk will give a tour of many kinds of visualization libraries on the web across the design space, while explaining the framework and design philosophy that the audience can learn along the way. The audience will expand their horizon and be more aware of the wide universe of libraries. The next time they come across a new package, they can use this framework as a lens to analyze its own offerings and how it is different from or similar to the libraries that they already know.},

In today's data-driven world, professionals need to know how to express themselves in the language of graphics effectively and eloquently. Yet information graphics is rarely taught in schools or is the focus of on-the-job training. Now, for the first time, Dona M. Wong, a student of the information graphics pioneer Edward Tufte, makes this material available for all of us. In this book, you will learn: to choose the best chart that fits your data;the most effective way to communicate with decision makers when you have five minutes of their time;how to chart currency fluctuations that affect global business;how to use color effectively;how to make a graphic ``colorful'' even if only black and white are available.The book is organized in a series of mini-workshops backed up with illustrated examples, so not only will you learn what works and what doesn't but also you can see the dos and don'ts for yourself. This is an invaluable reference work for students and professional in all fields. 500+ illustrations},

The paper begins with an extremely simple model of diagrams and proceeds through a series of incremental variations, all related somehow to the central theme of monoids. Along the way, I illustrate the power of compositional semantics; why you should also pay attention to the monoid's even humbler cousin, the semigroup; monoid homomorphisms; and monoid actions.},

Just how visualization relates to illustration, information graphics, digital art, visual languages, etc., is nonetheless poorly understood. We propose a theory that embeds information visualizationwithin other visual traditions in terms of criteria that are not purely technical: dependence on data, mapping, interactivity, and notationality. In addition to providing the means for a classification, these criteria also foster a different understanding of information visualization. We further adapt our criteria to differentiate within visualization, using mapping, readability and information loss, and notationality as the criteria. Both sets of criteria are demonstrated in a number of case studies.We believe that our novel taxonomies of visualization methods serve as a step towards a more comprehensive theoretical context to understanding the essential purposes, properties, and functions of information visualization.},
