* cartesian product - ordered pairs of all elements in A x B
### groups
* group $\subset$ monoid $\subset$ semigroups $\subset$ magma
* general definition of group
    * set + binary operation
    * has identity element (under operation)
    * has inverse elements (under operaion)
    * operation is associative 
    * group closed under operation
* magma
    * set + closed operation
* semigroup
    * magma + associative operation
* monoid group
    * semigroup + identity
* group
    * monoid + inverse

### functions
* domain - input set
* codomain - set of possible outputs 
* range - set of actual outputs of input set
* types:
    * general - many to one, range <= codomain
    * injective - one to one, range <= codomain
    * surjective - many to one, range == codomain
    * bijective - one to one, range == domain


### topology
* open set - set on space where boundary not in set, approx equiv to open inte*rval on line
* topological space - set of points + neighborhoods for each point
    * neighborhood - set of points containing the point p where can move away from point in any direction w/o  leaving the set (wiki)
        * ex: A set V in the plane is a neighbourhood of a point p if a small disc around p is contained in V.
    * product space - cartesian product of topological spaces
* fiber bundle $(E, B, \pi, F)$
    * E - total space
    * B - base space
    * $\pi: E \mapsto B$  - projection map (continuos surjection) 
    * F - fiber

###
* homology
* homomorphism
    * monomorphism - injective
    * epimorphism - surjective
    * isomorphism - bijective 
* {equi,in}variance
    * equivariance
    * invariance 
CW 
    * simplex
    * CW complex
    * simplacial complex
    * simplacial set
