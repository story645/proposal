set 
- finite or infinite collection of objects (elements), (grimaldi)
- elements are members of a set (grimaldi)
- order has no significance (wolfram)
- repetition (multiplicity) may or may not be ignored (wolfram)

operator (mif)
- a function that combines members of a set
- binary operation -> function w/ 2 arguments
- well defined: the operation is a function
    - input maps to 1 output
- * <- generic symbol for operations

group (mif)
- set  X + closed operator *
- identity: e, a \in X s.t. e*a = a
- inverses: a,b \in X s.t. a*b = e
- associative: a,b, c \in X s.t. (a*b)*c = a*(b*c) 
- closed: a, b, a*b \in X
- abelian: a*b = b*a (commutativity)

monoid
- group w/o inverses


symmetry
