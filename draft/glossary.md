set 
- finite or infinite collection of objects (elements), (grimaldi)
- elements are members of a set (grimaldi)
- order has no significance (wolfram)
- repetition (multiplicity) may or may not be ignored (wolfram)
    - sets w/ repetition are bags and/or multisets

poset (Grimaldi)
- set w/ partial ordering
- partial ordering defined by relation R that is (D7.6)
    - reflexive:  x \in A, (x,x) in R (D7.2)
    - transitive: x,y,z \in A, if (x,y), (y,z) \in R then (x,z) in R (D7.4)
    - antisymmetric: a,b in A, (a,b), (b,a) \in R iff a=b (D7.5)
- notation: (a,b) \in R <=> aRb

operator (mif)
- a function that combines members of a set
- binary operation -> function w/ 2 arguments
- well defined: the operation is a function
    - input maps to 1 output
- * <- generic symbol for operations

group (mif)(grimaldi: D16.1)
- set  X + closed operator *
- identity: e, a \in X s.t. e*a = a
- inverses: a,b \in X s.t. a*b = e
- associative: a,b, c \in X s.t. a*(b*c) = (a*b)*c 
- closed: a, b, a*b \in X
- abelian: a*b = b*a (commutativity) 
- theorems: (T16.1)
    1. identity is unique
    2. inverse of each element is unique
    3. left cancellation: a, b, c \in G, ab = ac then b=c
    4. right cancellation: a, b, c \in G, ba = ca, then b=c


category
- notation
    - fx <=> f(x)

-


monoid
- group w/o inverses
- category theory: object M w/ two morphisms:
    - multiplication: $\mu: M \bigotimes M \rightarrow M$ 
        - domain: product category
    - unit: $nu: I \rightarrow M$
