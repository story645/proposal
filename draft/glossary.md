* group
    * set + operation 
    * group has identity + inverse
    * operation is associative 
    * group closed under operation
* functions
    * domain - input set
    * codomain - set of possible outputs 
    * range - set of actual outputs of input set
    * types:
        * general - many to one, range <= codomain
        * injective - one to one, range <= codomain
        * surjective - many to one, range == codomain
        * bijective - one to one, range == domain
