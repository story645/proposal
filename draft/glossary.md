* cartesian product - ordered pairs of all elements in A x B
* group
    * set + operation 
    * group has identity + inverse
    * operation is associative 
    * group closed under operation
* functions
    * domain - input set
    * codomain - set of possible outputs 
    * range - set of actual outputs of input set
    * types:
        * general - many to one, range <= codomain
        * injective - one to one, range <= codomain
        * surjective - many to one, range == codomain
        * bijective - one to one, range == domain
* open set - set on space where boundary not in set, approx equiv to open interval on line
* topology
    * topological space - set of points + neighborhoods for each point
        * neighborhood - set of points containing the point p where can move away from point in any direction w/o  leaving the set (wiki)
            * ex: A set V in the plane is a neighbourhood of a point p if a small disc around p is contained in V.
        * product space - cartesian product of topological spaces
* fiber bundle $(E, B, \pi, F)$
    * E - total space
    * B - base space
    * $\pi: E \mapsto B$  - projection map (continuos surjection) 
    * F - fiber

    
* homology
* homomorphism
    * monomorphism - injective
    * epimorphism - surjective
    * isomorphism - bijective 
* {equi,in}variance
    * equivariance
