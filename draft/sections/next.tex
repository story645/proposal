\section{Discussion}

\subsection{What have we done}
presented mathematical framework w/ topological models for the things we have done. 
\subsection{What are the limitations?}
Is not useful for much yet.

\subsection{What else needs to be implemented?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item heatmaps/ proof of concept of face simplex
    \item composition algebra
    \item boxplot - multiglyph composition
    \item debatable: non-trivial bundle like data on mobius backend
    \item interactivity 
    \item concurrent artist
    \item numpy wrapper
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
    \item provisional implementation using new architecture in Matplotlib
    \item developer-aimed documentation (API + narrative)
    \item proof of concept 3rd party user-facing library with a biology partner
    \item academic paper about building visualization tools on top of the core architecture
\end{itemize}

\subsection{What are the lessons learned?}
