# Dissertation Proposal
Problem?
Solution?

Why? 

What? 

data + prior of what's important to preserve, language (model) to express data and what I want it to be preserved -> how do we build a library that allows for specifying constraints, transformation, users/domain developers 

invariance: what transforms on
focus: constraint preservation...., what are the problems people actually have where the solution would be constraint preservation, maths means its consistent
