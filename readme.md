# Dissertation Proposal
Problem?

Mislabled and inconsistently encoded marks or out of sync dashboards and streaming visualizations occur when the components out of which the visualization is built do not preserve structure; therefore we propose a functional structure preserving model of the transformations from multidimensional, multivariate, and labeled data space to visual space that developers can use to implement formally verifiable visualization library components.
